<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: EXPERIMENT

EXPERIMENT
Run code to test hypotheses, implement methods, and collect empirical results.
Runtime: Python 3.12, UV (any pip package), isolated workspace, gradual scaling (mini → full data).

</skills>

<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **HARD LIMIT**: Maximum $10 USD total spend on LLM API calls (OpenRouter). Track cumulative cost after every call and STOP IMMEDIATELY if approaching this limit. Never exceed this budget under any circumstances.
</software_constraints>
</available_resources>

<time_budget>

The experiment executor has 6h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Non-Gradient Flow Score for Citation Cartel Detection
hypothesis: >-
  Citation cartels create measurable non-gradient (rotational and harmonic) components in the Hodge decomposition of journal-level
  citation flows. In legitimate citation networks, flow is predominantly gradient-driven — citations flow hierarchically from
  lower-prestige to higher-prestige journals. Citation cartels, by their mutual reinforcement loops, inject divergence-free
  cyclic flows into the network. We hypothesize that the ratio of residual (non-gradient) flow energy to total flow energy
  within a candidate subgroup of journals — the Citation Vortex Score (CVS), defined as CVS(S) = ||f - f_grad||² / ||f||²
  — is a parameter-free, interpretable cartel detector that outperforms threshold-based baselines and degree-corrected null-model
  baselines on both synthetic and real Clarivate-suppressed journal groups. Critically, CVS measures the combined curl+harmonic
  residual after gradient extraction (not pure curl alone), which is nonetheless a valid anomaly signal because cartel-induced
  mutual citation loops elevate the non-gradient fraction relative to legitimate communities. On synthetic data with 8 injected
  cartel communities (15× mutual citation boost), CVS achieves AUC-ROC=1.0 vs. 0.892 for reciprocity ratio. The method's advantage
  over degree-corrected baselines (CIDRE-lite AUC=0.0 before sign correction) stems from avoiding the dcSBM's paradoxical
  normalization of large-journal cartel signal. Future validation must confirm this advantage holds on the 17 real Clarivate-suppressed
  journal cases available in the dataset, and sensitivity analysis at realistic boost levels (2×–10×) is needed to characterize
  the detection threshold. An optional extension — explicitly separating curl from harmonic via the triangle boundary operator
  B₂ — would produce a true 'Citation Vortex Score' in the strict topological sense and strengthen the theoretical framing.
motivation: >-
  Citation cartels damage science by inflating journal impact factors artificially, misallocating funding and researcher attention.
  Existing detection methods (CIDRE, threshold reciprocity) require careful parameter tuning (dcSBM thresholds, θ, θw), depend
  on a specific null model, and operate only at the journal level. A parameter-free method grounded in a first-principles
  decomposition of network flow would be more transparent, easier to audit, and potentially more robust. The Hodge decomposition
  separates any directed graph flow into an irrotational (gradient) component and a divergence-free (curl) component in a
  unique, lossless way — providing a direct physical interpretation: cartels are flow vortices. This cross-field import from
  mathematical physics / combinatorial topology has not been applied to citation integrity.
assumptions:
- >-
  Legitimate citation flow is predominantly hierarchical (gradient-driven): journals cite higher-prestige outlets more than
  those outlets cite them back, creating directed acyclic structure on average.
- >-
  Citation cartel behavior necessarily creates mutual reinforcement loops at the journal level, generating statistically detectable
  curl flow within the cartel subgroup.
- >-
  The journal-level citation graph (edge weight = number of cross-journal citations per year) is a sufficient representation
  for detecting cartel structure without paper- or author-level resolution.
- >-
  Clarivate's list of suppressed journals provides a reliable partial ground truth against which the CVS can be validated.
investigation_approach: |-
  1. DATA: Download journal-level citation aggregates from OpenAlex (free API, covers ~250M papers). For each pair of journals (i, j), compute the annual citation count c_{ij} for a selected year window (e.g., 2015–2022). Construct a directed weighted graph G = (V, E, w) where V = journals and w(i→j) = c_{ij}.

  2. HODGE DECOMPOSITION: Represent citation flows as a 1-chain on G. Compute the Hodge decomposition using the combinatorial gradient operator B1 (incidence matrix) and the curl operator B2 (triangle boundary matrix). Solve the least-squares system to extract the gradient component f_grad and residual curl+harmonic component f_curl. This reduces to sparse linear algebra (scipy.sparse.linalg.lsqr).

  3. SUBGROUP SCORING: For each candidate subgroup S (generated by Louvain community detection on the undirected projection of G), compute CVS(S) = sum of ||f_curl(e)||^2 for edges e within S, divided by sum of ||f(e)||^2 for edges e within S. Rank all subgroups by CVS descending.

  4. BASELINE COMPARISON: Implement CIDRE-lite (reciprocity-based excess citation fraction) and a simple reciprocity ratio baseline. Compare precision@K and recall@K against Clarivate's suspension list (46+ pairs), varying K.

  5. ABLATION: Test whether gradient-only component scores also help (e.g., gradient divergence as a complementary signal for journals that only receive but never give). Test temporal robustness across years.
success_criteria: |-
  CONFIRM: CVS achieves higher precision@20 and AUC-ROC than the reciprocity ratio baseline and matches or exceeds CIDRE-lite on the Clarivate suspension ground truth — demonstrating that the curl energy signal adds information beyond raw reciprocity counts. The method should flag at least 50% of confirmed cartel groups in the top decile of CVS-ranked subgroups.

  DISCONFIRM: If CVS performance is statistically indistinguishable from a simple pairwise reciprocity ratio (citations_ij / citations_ji), then the Hodge decomposition adds no information beyond what naive edge-level symmetry already captures, and the hypothesis should be rejected. If cartel groups do not consistently appear in the high-CVS tail but instead scatter uniformly across the CVS distribution, the vortex model does not describe cartel structure.
related_works:
- >-
  CIDRE (Sinatra & Rosvall, Scientific Reports 2021): Uses a degree-corrected stochastic block model (dcSBM) as a null model
  to identify journal groups with excessive within-group citations. Core mechanism is excess citation fraction relative to
  expected under dcSBM. CVS differs fundamentally — it uses no null model at all and requires no parameter tuning; instead
  it directly decomposes the observed flow into gradient vs. curl components via linear algebra, grounded in Hodge theory
  rather than a statistical generative model.
- >-
  HodgeRank (Jiang et al., Mathematical Programming 2011): Applies Hodge decomposition to pairwise ranking data to assess
  ranking consistency globally — the curl component flags inconsistencies in ranking preferences (e.g., movie ratings). CVS
  adapts this mechanism to a completely different task: detecting anomalous subgroups rather than assessing global ranking
  quality. CVS introduces the concept of a subgroup-local curl energy ratio as a cartel score, which HodgeRank does not compute.
- >-
  Toward the Discovery of Citation Cartels (Perez-Esparrells & Lopez-Otin, Frontiers in Physics 2016): Proposes threshold-based
  detection using semantic web tools and SPARQL queries on citation count graphs. Requires arbitrary threshold choice. CVS
  is parameter-free and more computationally scalable.
- >-
  Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Journal Citation Networks (Lazaridou et al., JCDL 2020): Uses graph autoencoders and node
  embedding reconstruction error. Deep learning black-box approach; CVS is fully interpretable and requires no training data
  or neural network.
- >-
  XRP Remittance Hodge Decomposition (Fujiwara et al., 2022): Applies Hodge decomposition globally to a cryptocurrency ledger
  to identify hierarchical vs. circular money flows at the network level. Does not define subgroup-level curl scores for anomaly
  detection and does not address citation networks or cartel identification.
inspiration: >-
  The inspiration comes from a Level 3 (methodological) cross-domain transfer from mathematical physics and combinatorial
  topology into citation network analysis. In fluid dynamics, any vector field can be uniquely decomposed (Helmholtz decomposition)
  into an irrotational gradient part and a divergence-free curl/rotational part. Exactly this decomposition exists for directed
  graph flows — the Hodge decomposition on simplicial complexes. HodgeRank applied this to ranking problems. The key transfer
  insight: what is called 'ranking inconsistency' in HodgeRank is precisely what is called 'circular mutual citation' in citation
  cartel literature. The same mathematical object (curl flow) describes both phenomena. Adapting the decomposition to output
  a per-subgroup anomaly score (CVS) — rather than a global ranking assessment — is the novel methodological step. Secondary
  inspiration: wash-trading detection in cryptocurrency markets, which identifies closed transaction cycles; the Hodge curl
  component is a principled, continuous generalization of cycle counting.
terms:
- term: Hodge Decomposition
  definition: >-
    A unique orthogonal decomposition of any flow defined on the edges of a directed graph into three components: (1) gradient
    flow — consistent with a global node potential, analogous to water flowing downhill; (2) curl flow — locally cyclic, forming
    closed loops around triangles in the graph; (3) harmonic flow — globally cyclic but locally consistent. Computed via sparse
    least-squares on the graph incidence and boundary matrices.
- term: Citation Vortex Score (CVS)
  definition: >-
    The ratio of curl flow energy to total flow energy within a candidate subgroup of journals: CVS(S) = Σ_{e∈S} f_curl(e)²
    / Σ_{e∈S} f(e)². A high CVS indicates that most citation flow within the group is circular rather than hierarchical, which
    is the mathematical signature of a citation cartel.
- term: Gradient Flow
  definition: >-
    The component of citation flow that is consistent with a global prestige ranking: journal A cites journal B more than
    B cites A, suggesting B is more prestigious. This is the expected, healthy pattern in citation networks.
- term: Curl Flow
  definition: >-
    The component of citation flow that forms closed loops: A cites B, B cites C, C cites A. This is irreconcilable with any
    global linear ranking and represents coordinated reciprocal behavior — the hallmark of a citation cartel.
- term: Citation Cartel
  definition: >-
    A group of journals (or authors) that coordinate to cite each other at rates far exceeding what subject overlap or normal
    scholarly interaction would predict, with the goal of artificially inflating their Journal Impact Factor or h-index.
- term: Incidence Matrix (B1)
  definition: >-
    A matrix encoding the directed graph structure, where each column represents an edge and each row represents a node; entry
    is +1 if the node is the edge head, -1 if it is the tail. Used in Hodge decomposition to solve for the gradient potential.
summary: >-
  We propose detecting citation cartels by applying Hodge decomposition to journal-level citation flow graphs, extracting
  a parameter-free Citation Vortex Score (CVS) that measures how much of each subgroup's citation activity is circular (curl)
  rather than hierarchical (gradient). Unlike CIDRE and other methods, CVS requires no null model or threshold tuning and
  provides a direct physical interpretation — cartels are vortices in the citation flow field.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Same Hodge frame; reframed CVS as curl+harmonic residual, added real-data validation requirement.
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Reframed CVS as measuring non-gradient (curl+harmonic residual) flow rather than claiming it measures pure curl flow — the
  current implementation does not separate curl from harmonic, so the 'vortex' framing is aspirational pending B₂ computation.
- >-
  Added explicit requirement for real-data validation against the 17 Clarivate ground-truth cases from cartel_ground_truth.json,
  which the experiment never used.
- >-
  Flagged that CIDRE-lite AUC=0.0 reflects sign inversion (perfect anti-correlation), not random failure — the baseline comparison
  must correct for this to be scientifically valid.
- >-
  Added requirement for sensitivity analysis across boost magnitudes (2×, 5×, 10×, 15×) to move beyond the toy 15× synthetic
  setting.
- >-
  Preserved the core claim that non-gradient flow is an effective cartel signal and that degree-corrected null models paradoxically
  suppress the signal for large cartel journals.
- >-
  Flagged optional path to true curl separation via B₂ as a strengthening extension, not a prerequisite for the core contribution.

objective: >-
  Validate CVS on real Clarivate-suppressed journal groups and characterize detection performance across realistic boost levels

approach: >-
  Load the real 96-journal OpenAlex citation network (art_oKw95zbMmpyR). Parse cartel_ground_truth.json from the dataset workspace
  to identify 17 Clarivate-suppressed journal groups. Run CVS on the real network, rank all detected communities by CVS score,
  and compute precision@5, precision@10, precision@20 by matching to ground truth (Jaccard overlap ≥0.5 threshold for valid
  match). Generate synthetic validation datasets at realistic boost levels: inject 2×, 5×, 10×, 15× mutual citation boosts
  into random 8-journal subsets and compute AUC-ROC for each boost level, producing an AUC-vs-boost sensitivity curve. Test
  method robustness by running CVS with 3 community detection algorithms (Louvain, Leiden, Infomap) and 10+ random seeds for
  Louvain to characterize stability. Implement proper baseline comparison: compute reciprocity ratio and CIDRE-lite with full
  sign correction (report both forward and sign-inverted AUC where appropriate to clarify anti-correlation). Output detailed
  results table with all metrics, per-boost AUC curves, per-method/seed distributions, and ground-truth matching details.

title: Journal Citation Network for Cartel Detection
summary: |-
  Dataset: journal_citation_network — a directed weighted journal-level citation network constructed from the OpenAlex REST API (free, no authentication required). The network covers publications from 2015–2022 across 96 high-impact journals (top 100 by global citation count, sourced via GET /sources sorted by cited_by_count:desc), with 888 directed edges representing cross-journal citation counts aggregated from 2,924 sampled papers. The closed-world construction algorithm is: (1) fetch top N journals; (2) for each journal fetch top-cited papers with referenced_works; (3) build paper→journal map; (4) count edges by looking up each referenced_work in the map — total API calls = N+1, no expensive resolution step.

  Each example corresponds to one journal node. The input field is a JSON string of per-journal network features: journal_name, issn_l, works_count, global_cited_by_count, in_degree, out_degree, in_citation_weight, out_citation_weight, mutual_citation_weight (sum of bidirectional citation counts — high values signal potential cartel behavior), citation_asymmetry (positive = net receiver / prestigious journal), mutual_citation_ratio (fraction of citations that are mutual), n_mutual_partners. The output field is 'normal' for the 96 top journals (none are on Clarivate's suppression list).

  The cartel ground truth is stored in temp/datasets/cartel_ground_truth.json: 17 verified cases from Clarivate JCR annual suppression lists (2013, 2018, 2024, 2025), including 12 citation-stacking cartels (e.g. the 2013 Brazilian cartel of 4 journals, 2025 MDPI/Wiley/Springer cases) and 5 self-citation cases. The research methodology is unsupervised anomaly detection — Hodge decomposition and Louvain community detection applied to the citation graph to find anomalous mutual-citation clusters, which are then validated against the ground truth suppression list. Graph statistics: 96 nodes, 888 edges, sparsity=0.097 (dense among top journals as expected), total citation count=2644.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: web search (Serper/Google), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — Serper.dev for search, html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and
   regex grep over the full document text. They work without any built-in web
   tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (Serper.dev / Google)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. Use it first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.
